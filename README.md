3. **Detailed Suggestions**:  
   - Offers actionable advice to enhance your resume, such as adding specific skills, quantifying achievements, or including relevant coursework.  

4. **Interview Preparation Topics**:  
   - Suggests critical topics to focus on for interview preparation based on the JD.  

5. **User-Friendly Interface**:  
   - Simple and intuitive UI powered by Streamlit for a seamless user experience.
